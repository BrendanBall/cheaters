    <div class="heading">Format for submission file</div>
    Submissions need to be uploaded as a zip file. The root of this zip file should contain folders named as users. Each folder should contain the source files belonging to that specific user.
    An example is shown below. </br></br>

                    If there is a substring match <i>at least</i> as long as <b>t</b>, then this match is guaranteed to be detected. Keep in mind that function and variable names will be replaced and counted as one character.

                    Sometimes there will be large matching blocks of code. If there is one line in the middle of the block somewhere, it will split the block in two. This parameter controls how many lines within a block are allowed to <i>not</i> match, without splitting the larger block.

                    This is a percentage. All matches smaller than this will be discarded.
